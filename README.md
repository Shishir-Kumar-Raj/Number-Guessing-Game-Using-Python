# Number Guessing Game Using Python

This Python program is a basic number guessing game designed for beginners. It randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 using the `random` module. The player has a total of five chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game offers feedback indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or accurate. If the player manages to guess the number within the allowed attempts, the program congratulates them and exits. Otherwise, once all attempts are used, the game reveals the hidden number. This project is ideal for those who are learning Python, as it helps reinforce foundational concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and functions. To play the game, ensure Python is installed, save the script in a `.py` file (e.g., `number_guess.py`), and run it through the command line. The game can be further improved by adding features like input error handling, adjustable difficulty settings, and an option to play again.
